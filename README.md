# BootstrapX

### BootstrapX = Bootstrap Examples

In this repository, you'll find the examples I played around with as I experiment with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I'm using the official [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/).

See the website for components and pictures: http://maxshalom.me/BootstrapX/

Also, if you'd like you can see the full HTML files and assets used in the [Components](https://github.com/MaxShalom/BootstrapX/tree/master/Components)
folder.
