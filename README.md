# BootstrapX

### BootstrapX = Bootstrap Examples

In this repository, you'll find the examples I played around with as I experiment with Bootstrap.

See the website for components and pictures: https://maxshalom.github.io/BootstrapX/

Also, if you'd like you can see the full HTML files and assets used in the [Components](https://github.com/MaxShalom/BootstrapX/tree/master/Components)
folder.
